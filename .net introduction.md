## 🧠 What is .NET?

**.NET** ek **software development framework** hai created by **Microsoft**  
jiska main kaam hai **apps ko build, run, aur manage** karna.

It provides:
- ✅ Common libraries (for file, data, UI, etc.)
- ✅ Language interoperability (C#, VB, F#, etc.)
- ✅ Runtime environment (CLR)
- ✅ Tools for web, desktop, mobile, and cloud apps

In short:  
👉 **“.NET = Platform to develop any type of application.”**

## ⚙️ Types of .NET

| Type | Description | Platform Support |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **.NET Framework** | Old version (Windows only) | Windows |
| **.NET Core** | Cross-platform & open-source version | Windows, Linux, macOS |
| **.NET 5 / 6 / 7 (Unified .NET)** | Latest, unified version of .NET Core | Cross-platform |

### 🔍 Simple Difference
| Feature | .NET Framework | .NET Core / .NET 6+ |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| Platform | Windows only | Cross-platform |
| Performance | Slower | Faster & lightweight |
| Open Source | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| Future Updates | Deprecated | Actively updated |

✅ **Now everything is under one name — “.NET” (no more separate Core/Framework).**

## ⚙️ Core Components of .NET

1️⃣ **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**  
- It’s the **heart of .NET** — runtime environment.  
- Executes your code and handles memory, security, and exceptions.  
👉 Think of it as **.NET’s brain that manages everything at runtime.**

---

2️⃣ **CLS (Common Language Specification)**  
- Defines **rules and standards** that all .NET languages must follow.  
- Ensures **language interoperability** (C#, VB, F# all can work together).  
👉 Basically, **CLS = universal grammar** for all .NET languages.

---

3️⃣ **CTS (Common Type System)**  
- Defines **how data types are declared and used** in .NET.  
- Makes sure all languages understand data types the same way.  
Example: `int` in C# = `Integer` in VB.NET.  
👉 **CTS = type translator** between languages.

### 💎 Summary Table

| Concept | Full Form | Role |
|----------|------------|------|
| **CLR** | Common Language Runtime | Executes code & manages memory |
| **CLS** | Common Language Specification | Common rules for all .NET languages |
| **CTS** | Common Type System | Defines how data types are handled |

## 🌐 What is ASP.NET?

**ASP.NET** is a **web development framework** built on top of .NET.  
It’s used to **build dynamic web apps, APIs, and websites**.

### 🚀 Key Features:
- Server-side web development  
- Supports C# and Razor syntax  
- Secure, fast, and scalable  
- Works with databases, authentication, and MVC pattern  

Example:
```csharp
public IActionResult Index() {
   return View();
}
````

👉 Basically, **ASP.NET = Web App Builder using .NET power.**

---

## 🧩 What is MVC?

**MVC** stands for **Model – View – Controller**
Ye ek **architectural pattern** hai jo code ko **organized, reusable, and maintainable** banata hai.

---

### 🔹 1️⃣ Model – “Data & Logic”

* Deals with **database & business logic**
* Fetches or stores data

```csharp
public class Student {
  public int Id { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

---

### 🔹 2️⃣ View – “User Interface”

* Handles **UI (HTML + Razor)**
* Displays data to the user

```cshtml
<h2>Hello @Model.Name!</h2>
```

---

### 🔹 3️⃣ Controller – “Connector / Brain”

* Controls the **flow between Model & View**
* Handles requests and responses

```csharp
public IActionResult Index() {
  var student = new Student { Name = "Wania" };
  return View(student);
}
```

### 💡 Why MVC is Used?

| Benefit                    | Explanation                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Separation of Concerns** | UI, logic, and data are separate        |
| **Easier Maintenance**     | Each part can be updated independently  |
| **Reusability**            | Code can be reused in multiple projects |
| **Testing Friendly**       | Easy to test individual parts           |

| **CLS**             | Common rules for languages    | Syntax standards            |
| **CTS**             | Type system for all languages | `int` = `Integer`           |
| **ASP.NET**         | Web app framework             | Dynamic Websites            |
| **MVC**             | Pattern for structure         | Model + View + Controller   |
